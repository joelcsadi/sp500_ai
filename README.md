# SP500_AI
This is a project that aims to implement AI and Machine learning in order to view the S&P500 Index Fund and provide you with insights within certain timeperiods. In future, I aim to create a chatbot that will allow the user to ask the AI whether to buy or sell shares at a particular time or to not take any further action based off of high risk factors
